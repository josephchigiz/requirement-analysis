# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
The Requirement Analysis Project focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements.


## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team systematically gathers, analyzes, defines, and validates all the needs and constraints of the final software product. Think of it as creating the blueprint for a house before laying a single brick.

This process ensures that all stakeholders (users, customers, and developers) share a clear, mutual understanding of what the system must do (features) and how well it must perform (quality attributes).
